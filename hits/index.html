        <h3>
          ElementTree motivation
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Typical edit/compile/deploy cycle for a developer focuses on a small segment of a potentially very large code base
          </li>
          <li>
            Want to aggressively optimize for this common cycle: make performance cost proportional to the change, rather than to the size of the workspace
          </li>
          <li>
            Create and manipulate “units of change” that are passed around to interested parties
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          Additional observations
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Clients want a delta of the workspace state between two moments in time</li>
          <li>Different clients may want deltas with different start and/or end points</li>
          <li>May need to keep track of hundreds of tree states at once</li>
          <li>How to efficiently represent all these different deltas in memory?</li>
          <li>How to compute these deltas without traversing entire workspaces?</li>

          More details
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Have only one complete tree, and represent all others as deltas</li>
          <li>Only one delta is mutable - representing current operation</li>
          <li>Immutability allows trees to share common parent and nodes to share children</li>
          <li>Each tree seems complete when traversing using API, but internal structure quite different</li>
          <li>Most common scenarios are nearly constant-time delta computation</li>

        <h3>
          Lessons learned
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Not all optimization is a speed-space tradeoff. Here we greatly reduced space required to represent states, and made delta calculation very fast</li>
          <li>Textbook data structures work very well in most programming situations, but sometimes 
          a very specialized structure is called for</li>
          <li>Internal representation of a data structure can be radically different from external appearance</li>

          Platform fidelity vs portability
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Java emphasises portability of application code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Technique 1: lowest common denominator in native code, 
            Or, native implementation is avoided and platform fidelity is lost.
          </li>
          <li>
            Different native implementations used to fulfill common Java API contract
