          ElementTree motivation
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Typical edit/compile/deploy cycle for a developer focuses on a small segment of a potentially very large code base
          </li>
          <li>
            Want to aggressively optimize for this common cycle: make performance cost proportional to the change, rather than to the size of the workspace
          </li>
          <li>
            Create and manipulate “units of change” that are passed around to interested parties

          Additional observations
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Clients want a delta of the workspace state between two moments in time</li>
          <li>Different clients may want deltas with different start and/or end points</li>
          <li>May need to keep track of hundreds of tree states at once</li>

          <li>Have only one complete tree, and represent all others as deltas</li>
          <li>Only one delta is mutable - representing current operation</li>
          <li>Immutability allows trees to share common parent and nodes to share children</li>
          <li>Each tree seems complete when traversing using API, but internal structure quite different</li>
          <li>Computing deltas is nearly free for most common operations</li>

        <h3>
          Lessons learned
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Not all optimization is a speed-space tradeoff. Here we greatly reduced space required to represent states, and made delta calculation very fast</li>
          <li>Textbook data structures work very well in most programming situations, but sometimes 
          a very specialized structure is called for</li>
          <li>Internal representation of a data structure can be radically different from external appearance</li>

          <li>Introduced separation between command and handler</li>
          <li>Key bindings are bound to commands, command get bound to handlers</li>
          <li>Relationship between binding and command is fairly stable</li>
          <li>Keybinding information is almost always served from cache in regular usage</li>
          <li>Relationship between command and handler still needs updating on each part activation</li>
          <li>Only need to process commands that have a handler specific to that part</li>

            you need a fundamental rethink</li>
          <li>Creating a pure "model" layer between user inputs and resulting actions was very powerful</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Update manager only resolved dependencies at the feature level</li>
          <li>Features that were already installed would never be reconsidered when installing something else</li>
          <li>This could lead to some feature you didn't really care about blocking install of something you really wanted</li>
          <li>Resolving dependencies could sometimes be slow but was generally usable</li>
          <li>Redundant expression of dependencies at feature and plugin level was a source of bugs</li>

        <h3>Observations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Observation: some installed things are "roots" that the user chose to install, 
other things are installed only to satisfy dependencies	</li>
          <li>In p2 we wanted to ensure all dependencies were satisfied - feature, bundle, and package level</li>
          <li>This is an NP hard constraint satisfaction problem, and our hand-crafted resolver wasn't good enough</li>
