Statements of this type may be included in other filings with Canadian securities regulators or the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or in other communications. All such statements are made pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of, and are intended to be forward-looking statements under, the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and any applicable Canadian securities legislation. Forward-looking statements may involve, but are not limited to, comments with respect to our objectives and priorities for 2012 and beyond, our strategies or future actions, our targets, expectations for our financial condition or share price, and the results of or outlook for our operations or for the Canadian and U.S. economies.

					By their nature, forward-looking statements require us to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. There is significant risk that predictions, forecasts, conclusions or projections will not prove to be accurate, that our assumptions may not be correct and that actual results may differ materially from such predictions, forecasts, conclusions or projections. We caution readers of this Annual Report not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements as a number of factors could cause actual future results, conditions, actions or events to differ materially from the targets, expectations, estimates or intentions expressed in the forward-looking statements.

					The future outcomes that relate to forward-looking statements may be influenced by many factors, including but not limited to: general economic and market conditions in the countries in which we operate; weak, volatile or illiquid capital and/or credit markets; interest rate and currency value fluctuations; changes in monetary, fiscal or economic policy; the degree of competition in the geographic and business areas in which we operate; changes in laws or in supervisory expectations or requirements, including capital, interest rate and liquidity requirements and guidance; judicial or regulatory proceedings; the accuracy and completeness of the information we obtain with respect to our customers and counterparties; our ability to execute our strategic plans and to complete and integrate acquisitions; critical accounting estimates and the effect of changes to accounting standards, rules and interpretations on these estimates; operational and infrastructure risks; changes to our credit ratings; general political conditions; global capital markets activities; the possible effects on our business of war or terrorist activities; disease or illness that affects local, national or international economies; natural disasters and disruptions to public infrastructure, such as transportation, communications, power or water supply; technological changes; and our ability to anticipate and effectively manage risks associated with all of the foregoing factors.

				<h2>The path forward</h2>
				<ul>
				<li>Software services are being decoupled from specific devices.</li>
				<li>We will be able to use the interface device that is most suitable for a given task.</li>
				<li>Several axes at play:
					<ul>
					<li>Social vs asocial tasks</li>
					<li>Consuming versus producing data</li>
					<li>Environmental constraints on form factor</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Innovation and technology advances are enabling move towards more 
				appropriate form factors</li>

					And it&apos;s not that HTML5 is bad. I'm actually, on long-term, really excited about it. One of the
things that's interesting is we actually have more people on a daily basis
using mobile Web Facebook than we have using our iOS or Android apps
combined. So mobile Web is a big thing for us.				</blockquote>

				<h2>Furious innovation</h2>
				<ul>
				<li>Build time: PhoneGap, Tabris, Quark App Studio, GWT Mobile</li>
				<li>Languages: Dart, TypeScript, CoffeeScript</li>
				<li>Runtimes: Chrome/Firefox OS, SPDY</li>
				<li>Frameworks: Sencha, jQuery, Tiggzi, Widgetbox, appMobi</li>
				<li>There will be a shift towards more cross-platform solution - content producers will demand it.</li>
				<li>Nobody knows what that will look like.</li>

				<h2>Eclipse impact: servers</h2>
				<ul>
				<li>Server side will continue to be vital</li>
				<li>Java and OSGi/Equinox still very compelling</li>
				<li>Other alternatives: PHP, Ruby/Rails, Go, ASP, Perl, Node</li>
				<li>Eclipse innovation: Equinox, Jetty, Virgo, Gemini, Gyrex</li>
				<li>Don't marry your client to a particular server technology</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Eclipse impact: tools</h2>
				<ul>
				<li>Programming is inherently social and the data will want to be in the cloud.</li>
				<li>Desktop stil well suited for many tasks.</li>
				<li>Gradual evolution toward web (bugzilla, gerrit, stackoverflow, hudson)</li>
				<li>Eclipse Platform 4 will enable the transition</li>
				<li>Eclipse innovation: Orion, WikiText, Hudson</li>
				<li>Make your tooling functionality loosely coupled</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Eclipse impact: rich clients</h2>
				<ul>
				<li>Highly depends on your functionality and end users</li>
				<li>Eclipse 4 RCP opens doors: CSS styling, pluggable renderer</li>
				<li>Java clients will become niche</li>
				<li>Paths forward for existing code: move to server, cross compile to client</li>
				<li>Eclipse innovation: Eclipse Platform 4, Scout, RAP mobile, Riena</li>
				<li>Make your functionality loosely coupled</li>

				<h2>Community is our most valuable asset</h2>
				<p>Eclipse is the best place to do commercial friendly open source</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Strong legal controls</li>
				<li>Predictable schedules</li>
				<li>Committer infrastructure</li>
